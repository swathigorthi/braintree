Assumptions:
===========
1) Adding an existing person with a new card or existing card is ignored. Basically, person is the primary key
2) Negative charges or credits are ignored.
3) CTRL+Z exits the program execution and prints the summary. 
4) The given specification that - 
  "Your program must accept three input commands passed with space delimited
  arguments" 
  has been taken to mean that, names have the following format : <FirstName> and not <Firstname Lastname>

Design Decisions:
================
1) Made AccountBook a singleton class, since we want to maintain only one map of all users and their cards.
2) Used a sorted map to save the name to account map. Easy to print the summary in alphabetical order
3) Made name, card and limit information final in Account class, so they cannot be altered and can be set only through constructor
4) Made charge  & credit methods are thread safe. This is a conscious decision, so that in the future if it is necessary to read and process multiple inputs we do not run into race conditions.
5) have used java as my programming language, as I have more experience with it.  

Dependencies:
============
1) Unzip the folder contents to $WORKSPACE
2) Download hamcrest-core-1.3.jar from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hamcrest/hamcrest-core/1.3 and copy it to $WORKSPACE/braintree/lib/
3) Download junit-4.10.jar from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit/4.10 and copy it to $WORKSPACE/braintree/lib/

Instructions to execute the program and running tests:
=====================================================
1) Open cmd and navigate to $WORKSPACE\braintree\src
2) To compile: a) cd bt
               b) javac -cp $WORKSPACE\braintree\src;$WORKSPACE\braintree\lib\junit-4.10.jar *.java
               
3) To process an input file, place in in src folder and a) cd to src
                                                        b) java -cp $WORKSPACE\braintree\src bt.ProcessInput < input.txt
                                                         or java -cp $WORKSPACE\braintree\src bt.ProcessInput input.txt
                                                        c) Enter more commands like: Add phoebe 123456789012345 $1000 ...
                                                        d) To terminate the program , press CTRL+ Z
4) To run tests: a) cd to src
                 b) java -cp $WORKSPACE\braintree\src;$WORKSPACE\braintree\lib\junit-4.10.jar bt.TestRunner
                   or java -cp $WORKSPACE\braintree\src;$WORKSPACE\braintree\lib\junit-4.10.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore bt.AccountTest
